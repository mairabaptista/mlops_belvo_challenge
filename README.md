# MLops Take Home Challenge

Welcome to the repository for MLE(Ops) test!

There are three main files that will guide the solution design:
1. Part 1: Design specifications for the challenge's MLOps requirements.
2. Part 2: Assumptions and decisions made during crafting the demo for a component from Part 1. Any files that are not markdown are part of Part 2's demo. 
3. Part 3: Design specifications for the challenge's MLOps future requirements.
